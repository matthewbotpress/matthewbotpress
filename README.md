## üèÜ Projects

### ConUHacks IX - Sun Life Sponsored Challenge Winner
*February 2025*

You can find the project specs [here](https://devpost.com/software/finsurance). The open-source repository is [here](https://github.com/SophiaClifton/hashbrown-app).

My contributions are under the '@mpetruzziello' handle.

What the project entails:

Developed a full-stack financial wellness web application that secured first place in the Sun Life Sponsored Challenge. Integrated a friendly AI chatbot ‚ÄúFin‚Äù, built with Botpress, to fetch transactions from a PostgreSQL backend and provide real-time budgeting advice on a React/Node.js frontend.

Designed interactive budgeting tools, a financial literacy quiz, and accessibility features (e.g. screen-reader support, audio playback) to improve financial literacy and inclusivity for all users.

Leveraged a Python FastAPI framework for secure user authentication and account data retrieval.

### McGill Rocket Team - Software Team Member (Radios Subteam)
*September 2024 - November 2024*

Built test software for sending and receiving radio signals from the ground station to the rocket using C++ and Teensy 4.0/4.1 microcontrollers.

### Ilys Programming Language
*August 2024*

Created a lexer and parser for a custom programming language called Ilys. Both are written in C++. I started this project to get prepared for my OCaml course. I do want to learn compiler design in the future and will come back to this project. See it [here](https://github.com/mpetruzziello/Ilys-Programming-Language).
